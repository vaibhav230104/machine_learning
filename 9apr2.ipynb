    "# Q1. A company conducted a survey of its employees and found that 70% of the employees use the company's health insurance plan, while 40% of the employees who use the plan are smokers. What is the probability that an employee is a smoker given that he/she uses the health insurance plan?\n",

    "\n",
    "# Bernoulli Naive Bayes handles binary/boolean features and assumes that each feature is a binary variable.\n",
    "# Multinomial Naive Bayes is suitable for features representing counts or frequencies and considers the frequency of occurrences.\n",

    "# Q3. How does Bernoulli Naive Bayes handle missing values?\n",
